# How to run this code
This code can be run on the browser console.

# My approach
This approach uses manual state management in by creating a custom class (TallyStateManager) to track and update an internal state (count). The state transitions are controlled through actions (like ADD, SUBTRACT, and RESET), and the system logs detailed information about each action.

# Challenges 
The logic of how to structure and handle different actions was the major challenge. How I overcame it was by breaking it down into smaller parts and writing it down on a piece of paper before writing the code.
